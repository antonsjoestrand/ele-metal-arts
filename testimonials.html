						<p>We spoke with Elaine regarding her recent project
						"Rivera". She is a strong and dedicated artist that
						truly has passion for her work. What makes her stand out
						is not just her amazing sculptures, but her dedication
						to connect with her clients and bring their vision to
						life. We simply can't wait to see what she does next.</p>

						<p>To say that Elaine Turis is a talented artist is an
						understatement. We are amazed by the creative process
						that goes on behind her artwork. You can clearly tell
						that her work is designed to create emotion and beauty
						to their environment. We just love the incredible detail you
						can see in every single one of her pieces.</p>

						</div>
						<p>It was an honor for both me and Harley-Davidson to
						work with Elaine on this project. She brought our vision
						to life with ease and even gave us suggestions to make
						the eagle better than we could have ever imagined. We
						get customers asking about the eagle all the time. We
						will proudly present the Harley Eagle on the floor of
						our dealership for years to come. A second sculpture for
						another one of our dealerships is already in the
						works, and we have no doubt that Elaine will blow us away
						again!</p>

						<p>I came to Elaine with a very special request that was
						close to my heart, to recreate my vision for the
						Imperial Water Dragon. And wow did she manage to do
						that! She told me that it was going to be a challenge
						and I completely understood that. But I never expected
						her to exceed my expectations in every way imaginable.
						The only way to describe it is if someone looked into
						your mind and painted an accurate picture of what you
						were imagining, and then made it ten times better. The
						dragon now rests in Central Park and everyone I've seen
						walk by have just been amazed by it!</p>

						<p>Everything about this project is just perfection. The
						name, the style, the detail, everything. Elaine told me
						about her interest for eagles and I knew immediately
						that she was the right one for the job. We spent a lot
						of time deciding on positioning and smaller details like
						how much the eagle's beak was going to be open. And that
						is really what makes Elaine stand out from the rest, she
						cares about every single detail you could possibly
						imagine. The end result blew my mind more than I can
						even describe. It is proudly displayed in the heart of
						downtown Los Angeles, and people have told me time and
						time again how beautiful it is. I will keep Elaine in
						mind for all of our future projects and artwork we might
						need.</p>

						</div>
						<p>It is safe to say that we quickly realized that
						Elaine was perfect for this project when she told us
						about how she grew up watching native carvers and pole
						builders. The combination of that and her incredible
						artistic style is truly what brought this totem to life.
						We loved it so much that we asked her to create a second
						smaller sculpture for our park. We call it "The Mystical
						Owl" and Elaine once again did a fantastic job! People
						come to the park just to see these two sculptures, which
						I think is pretty amazing!</p>
